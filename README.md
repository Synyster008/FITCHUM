# FITCHUM
The main aim of the proposed app "FITCHUM" app is to promote a healthy lifestyle by utilizing smartphone sensor data and PPG (photoplethysmography) technology to monitor an individual's heart rate, steps taken, and sleep quality. The app will provide personalized insights and recommendations to help users achieve their health goals.
To achieve this, the app will use the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to track the user's steps taken and physical activity. Additionally, the app will utilize PPG technology to monitor the user's heart rate and sleep quality. PPG technology works by shining a light on the skin to detect changes in blood flow, which can be used to determine heart rate and sleep patterns.
The data collected by the app will be analyzed to provide personalized insights and recommendations to the user. For example, if the app detects that the user is not getting enough sleep, it may recommend adjusting their bedtime routine or suggest relaxation techniques to improve sleep quality.
Furthermore, the app will allow users to compare their insights with themselves over time and among their peers. This feature will encourage healthy competition and motivate users to achieve their health goals.
To ensure user privacy, all data collected by the app will be encrypted and stored securely. Users will have complete control over their data and can choose to share it with others as they see fit.
In summary, the app "FITCHUM" is designed to utilize the sensors in a smartphone and PPG technology to track an individual's health, offering tailored statistics and recommendations based on their predefined goals, and enabling them to compare their progress with others who have similar health profiles.
